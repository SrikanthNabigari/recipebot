            "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Peel the squash and separate the bulbous seed-bearing section from the slender end. Chop the slender end into 2cm cubes, toss in half the oil, season lightly and roast in the oven, stirring occasionally, until golden brown on the outside and soft in the centre, about 30 mins. Cut the bulb in half and scrape out the seeds with a spoon \u2013 you can keep these to toast in the oven and sprinkle over salads. Chop the flesh into 2cm pieces. Warm the vegetable stock in a small pan, set over a low heat. Drop in squash and leave to gently poach.",
            "While the squash is roasting, warm a medium-size frying pan over a gentle heat. Add the remaining olive oil and half the butter, followed by the onion. Cover and cook for 3 mins until the onion turns translucent. Stir in the celery, garlic, herbs and a few turns of pepper (no salt at this stage). Cover again and cook for a further 2 mins. Increase the heat slightly and stir in the rice. Stir, uncovered, for about 5 mins \u2013 this will help to develop the toasty aroma of the rice without burning the veg.",
            "Turn up the heat, stir in the wine and let it bubble away to almost nothing. Reduce the heat and start adding the stock. Add one ladle at a time, stirring gently but constantly during each addition. The idea is to encourage the rice to absorb the liquid and soften, but also give up its starch to thicken the remaining broth. Don\u2019t stir too aggressively or you will end up with a pan of mush. When the stock has been absorbed, it\u2019s time to add the next ladleful and so on. It will take about 15 mins to reach the final ladle of stock. By this time the squash in the stock should have softened. Mash it up with the remaining stock and stir into the risotto.",
            "Turn off the heat, dot the top of the risotto with remaining butter and most of the Parmesan, cover, leave to rest for 2 mins, then stir through and check the seasoning. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls and sprinkle the roasted squash and leftover Parmesan on top. Serve with crusty bread and Saut\u00e9ed spinach (below)."

Bake in the oven until the bread is completely dry and browned just a little \u2013 this will take about 20 mins. Remove from the oven and rub with the garlic cloves while still warm. Use a whole clove on each slice, or half if you have small slices. Leave the toasted slices to cool, then put them in a food processor and blitz to rough but not too big breadcrumbs. Empty the crumbs into a mixing bowl and add the dried sage and onion, the parsley and a good pinch of sea salt. Mix together, then set aside in an airtight container. Can be made up to 2 days ahead without the parsley (see tip, below left).",

Tie the loin with butcher\u2019s string to help keep its shape and cook evenly. Heat the rapeseed oil in an ovenproof frying pan and add the pork, fat-side down. Sear and brown the top layer of fat, then turn the pork over and throw in the butter, garlic, rosemary, thyme, pepper and 2 tsp table salt. Once the butter has melted, add the lemon zest and juice to create a fragrant cooking liquor. Roll the pork around in the buttery juices and baste so that it is well coated.",

If the meat hasn\u2019t reached the temperature, return it to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Once the pork is cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10 mins. If you don\u2019t have a digital thermometer, cook the pork for 1 hr 20 mins.",

Whisk in the polenta and cook over a medium heat until thickened, following pack instructions \u2013 it needs to be the texture of creamy mash. If your polenta is too thick, add a little more milk to loosen it. When it is ready, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, Parmesan, lemon zest, truffle oil, fresh truffle (if using), salt and the cayenne to taste. Pour into a serving bowl and sprinkle over the chives.",

Add the breadcrumbs, herbs, pistachios, feta, cherries, lemon and tahini. Season and mix everything together. Unroll the lamb and season well on both sides. Pack the stuffing down the centre of the lamb, pressing to help it stick, then re-roll and tie up with kitchen string (see tip, below left). Flip the lamb over so it is seam-side down, and pack any stuffing that has fallen out back in. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",

Cut down the centre of the thinner piece, then slice very thinly into half moons. Halve the bottom piece and scoop out the seeds, then thinly slice this too. Whisk the tahini, cream and stock in a jug with some seasoning. Arrange the sliced squash in a shallow ovenproof baking dish, approximately 22 x 30cm, seasoning well between the layers. Finish with a layer of neatly lined-up half moon slices. Pour over the tahini stock.",

Spoon any excess fat off the top of the gratin, then return to the oven for 20 mins until golden and crisp.

At this low temperature an electric oven will be more accurate (if using gas, check regularly).",

In a separate saucepan, reduce the stock to 300ml, then pour it over the shallot with the sloe gin. Bring to a simmer and reduce slightly.

            "Mix together the flour and baking powder. Beat both the sugars and butter together in a large bowl with an electric hand beater until light and creamy. Break in 1 egg and beat well, then beat in the second egg (the mix will look curdled). Sift half the flour mixture over the sponge mixture and fold in gently. Carefully stir in half the milk, then repeat with the rest of the flour and milk, followed by the orange zest and reserved grated apple.",
            "Spoon two-thirds of the sponge mixture over the fruit mix in the basin and level off. Spread the rest of the fruit on top, followed by the remaining sponge mix. Place the basin in a small roasting tin half filled with hot water. Bake for 1\u00bc hrs (lay foil over the top for the last 15 mins if it is browning too quickly) until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.",
            "While the pudding is baking, make the custard. Mix the sugar, custard powder and cornflour with 1 tbsp of the milk to make a paste. Beat in the egg yolk. Pour the remaining milk into a pan, slit the vanilla pod lengthways and scrape in the vanilla seeds. Add the pod to the milk and bring just to the boil. Pour this over the cornflour mix, stir, then pour into a clean pan. Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.",
            "Loosen pudding from the sides of the basin with a round-bladed knife and carefully invert it onto a serving plate. Serve with the custard."

Remove from the heat, but leave the chicken in the liquid to cool for about 3 hrs. When cold, lift the chicken out of the stock then strain (skim off any fat from the stock) and keep 200ml for the sauce. Can be done a day ahead and chilled. The excess stock can be chilled the frozen.",

Pur\u00e9e the apricots in a small blender with the reserved liquid then press through a sieve (you should get about 1 tbsp pur\u00e9e). Remove curry sauce from the heat then stir in the sugar. Strain through a sieve, pressing as much through as you can with a wooden spoon, then stir in the lime juice and apricot pur\u00e9e and leave until cold.",

Strip the meat off the bones in chunky pieces, remove the breasts separately and thickly slice. Gently toss the chicken with the curried sauce, the coriander and most of the mango. Scatter the watercress onto a platter. Spoon the chicken mix on top, tuck in the rest of the mango and finish with a pile of (drained) spring onions."

            "Make the custard: blend the sugar, custard powder and cornflour with 1 tbsp milk to make a runny paste. Beat in the egg yolk. Pour the remaining milk into a pan, scrape in the vanilla seeds, add the pod, then allow to come just to the boil. Stir this into the cornflour paste, then pour into a clean pan. Cook over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until thickened. Remove from the heat, then stir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche until smooth. Pour into a bowl, cover the surface with cling film to stop a skin forming, allow to cool, then chill until completely cold.",
            "Make the cake: heat oven to 180C/ fan 160C/gas 4. Lightly oil and line the base of a 20cm round cake tin. Put the sugar and eggs into a bowl. Whisk with electric beaters for 5 mins until very thick, paler in colour and the consistency of whipped cream. Sift over the flour and quickly, but lightly, fold it in. Spoon the mixture into the tin and carefully level it, being careful not to squash it. Bake for 25 mins until risen, then remove and cool on a wire rack. Peel off lining paper. Halve the cake so you have a semi-circle. (The other half can be frozen for another time.) Split the semi-circle in half with a knife, then sandwich back together with fruit spread.",
            "Put the sugar and lime zest for the fruit into a pan with 2 tbsp water. Bring slowly to the boil until the sugar has dissolved, then bubble for 1\u00bd-2 mins until syrupy. Tip in the blueberries, then cook very briefly, stirring once or twice only, just until they start to burst and release their juices (but still stay whole) and you get a purple syrup. Set aside to cool.",
            "The sponge and custard layers can be built up to 2-3 hrs ahead of when you want to serve. Cut the jammy sponge into cubes, then place in the base of a glass dish. Drizzle over the Marsala. Keep about \u00bc of the berries back for the top, then spoon the rest over the sponge with a little syrup. Discard the pod from the custard, then pour it over the fruit.",
            "Just before serving, beat the yogurt, mascarpone and sugar together until smooth and creamy. Pile onto the custard, then drizzle over the reserved fruit and syrup. Use a skewer to swirl some of the juices through the creamy topping. Serve straight away or the syrup discolours the topping. This is best eaten the same day."

Lightly whisk the egg white with a balloon whisk until frothy and bubbly, but not too stiff. Pour the water into the flour mix, gently and briefly whisking as you go. The batter shouldn\u2019t be completely smooth. Add the egg white, then lightly whisk in just to mix. Try and keep as many bubbles as you can so the batter stays light. Cooking two pieces of fish at a time, dip them in the batter to coat, let some of it drip off, then lower into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry for 5-6 mins, making sure the oil stays at 200C and turning the fish over halfway through so it is golden all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper. Check the oil is back up to 200C, then repeat with remaining fish. Reheat the peas and serve with the fish, chips and lemon wedges."

Cook \u2013 don\u2019t move them or they may stick \u2013 for 5 mins for medium, brush the unoiled side with the rest of the oil (C), then turn and cook for another 5 mins.

Do the same with 5 more of the sponge fingers, trimming to fit if necessary, so that they cover the bottom of the tin. Spoon over half of the filling, spreading it to cover the biscuits (see step 3), then repeat the biscuit dipping with 6 more of them. Spoon and spread over the rest of the filling, then dip and lay the rest of the sponge fingers over the top (see step 4). Bring the cling film overhang over to cover. Chill overnight.",

Put 75g of the sugar in a small pan and add 100ml water and the orange pieces. Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved, then turn up the heat and simmer for 10 mins. Allow the orange to cool slightly, then either blitz with a stick blender or liquidise to a pulp. Crush the coriander seeds using a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder, then add to the warm orange pulp along with the polenta. Stir to combine, then leave to cool.",

Put the butter, flour, baking powder, eggs and the remaining 100g caster sugar in a large mixing bowl along with the cooled orange pulp. Mix until thoroughly blended using an electric hand mixer. Spoon into the prepared tin and bake for 35-45 mins or until springy to the touch \u2013 a skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean. The cake should be pale in colour and just leaving the sides of the tin. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool.",
            "Meanwhile, prepare the decoration. Using a potato peeler, peel half the zest from the orange into large strips, then slice very thinly so that you have lots of orange zest shreds (like you would for marmalade). Put the caster sugar and 100ml water in a small saucepan set over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then add the orange shreds. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 8-10 mins until the shreds are quite soft. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside on a tray lined with baking parchment.",
            "When the cake has cooled, sift the icing sugar into a small bowl. Juice the orange and add enough of it to the icing sugar to make a runny icing. Drizzle the icing over the cooled cake and scatter the orange shreds on top."

Put the hazelnuts into a food processor with 2 tbsp of the sugar, then pulse until finely chopped. Don\u2019t expect them to go as fine as ground almonds and avoid over-processing, as this can make the nuts greasy.",
            "Put the butter, milk and coffee powder into a small pan and heat gently until the butter has melted. Set aside.",
            "Now start the sponge. Crack the eggs into the bowl of a tabletop mixer, add the rest of the sugar and beat for 5-10 mins (or beat with an electric hand mixer in a large deep bowl for 15-20 mins) or until thick and billowy, and the mixture leaves a trail that holds for a couple of seconds. It is really important that the mixture has thickened, almost doubling in size, in order to achieve a light sponge.",
            "Mix the cornflour, plain flour and 1/2 tsp salt, and sift onto the whisked mixture. Using a large metal spoon, fold in very carefully. Sprinkle in the ground nuts, then fold these in too. Pour the warm milk mix around the edge of the bowl, and fold this in. Don\u2019t rush the folding, and continue with a light lifting and cutting motion until ribbons of liquid stop appearing. Divide the batter between the tins, then bake for 25 mins until risen to the middle and a burnished gold.",
            "Loosen the sides of the cakes with a palette knife, then cool in the tins on a rack for 20 mins (the cakes will level off, and possibly go a bit wrinkly, but that\u2019s normal). Carefully remove from the tins and cool, paper-side down.",
            "Make the syrup and the frosting while you wait. Put the sugar and 4 tbsp water into a small pan. Bring to the boil and leave for 1 min then take off the heat. Stir in the coffee and alcohol. Beat the mascarpone, hazelnut chocolate spread and coffee together with a wooden spoon, until silky and even.",
            "To assemble, cut the cold cakes horizontally across the middle, using a long serrated knife. With a pastry brush, dampen the cut surfaces all over with the syrup. Use it all. Put one cake layer onto a plate or stand, cut-side up. Spoon on 3 generous dollops of the frosting, then spread to the edges with a palette knife. The frosting should be about 5mm deep. Repeat with the next two layers. When you come to the final layer, place it cut-side down, so that the top of the cake is smooth. Paddle the rest of the frosting over the top and sides of the cake. The layer on the top can be thin. Clean the knife then use it to press a neat ring of nuts into the frosting on the side of the cake. Brush any excess away.",
            "For the topping, put 3 tbsp of the cream, 1 tsp icing sugar and 1 tbsp milk into a small bowl. Put the rest of the cream, milk and sugar, plus most of the dissolved coffee into a larger bowl. Whip the white cream, then the coffee cream, until they look like soft cappuccino froth, thick but still able to flow from a spoon. Pour most of the coffee cream onto the cake and push it out to cover the top. Whisk a little more coffee into what is left, so that it turns a few shades darker.",
            "To decorate with a characteristic latte \u2018tree\u2019 shape, load a pointy teaspoon with a little of the white cream. Start at the base of the tree, just right of the centre of the cake. Push the spoon into the coffee cream and let the white cream flow slowly. As it flows, drag the spoon then pull it gently away, to make a leaf-like shape. Repeat with more white cream on the left to make another leaf, then repeat 3-4 times, working up the cake top graduating from large to small leaves. Use the same technique to sweep a couple of arc shapes around the edge of the pattern.",
            "Use the dark cream to add detail to each leaf \u2013 you can paint this on with the tip of a teaspoon or a clean cocktail stick. Use a cocktail stick to drag the points of each leaf up and outwards. Draw a line down from the top of the \u2018tree\u2019 to the bottom to finish. The cake will keep for up to 2 days. Loosely cover any cut edges but avoid covering the cake directly as you could damage the decoration. Serve from the fridge or at cool room temperature."

My cakes were light and airy and rose to perfection - the trick is definitely whipping the eggs and sugar for a good 20 minutes, no skimping!\nI made my Nutella frosting with mascarpone, cream cheese and a touch of creme fraiche (making 1.5 times the amount in the recipe) and it filled my cakes beautifully.\nIt went down an absolute storm! Will definitely be making this one again."

Fold a tea towel into a strip and lie it on a firmly positioned chopping board (held in place underneath by some damp kitchen towel). Put the oysters on the towel, curved-side down, and wrap the tea towel over to sandwich it. Use a strong knife, preferably a shucking knife, to firmly pierce the hinge of the oyster, then turn it to open the oyster until you hear it pop. Work the knife around the edge of the shell, being careful not to cut into the oyster, until you can remove the lid. Disconnect the oyster from its shell on the bottom so it slides out easily.",

Whisk 6 eggs in a jug with \u00bd tbsp of the vanilla, then gradually add to the creamed butter, beating between additions. Once combined, sift in 400g of the flour, and mix in 60g of ground almonds and add the zest of 6 lemons. Gently stir in 3 tbsp of the lemon juice.",
            "Scrape into the prepared cake tin and level the top with a spatula. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 1 hr. Don\u2019t worry if the top looks a little dark, as this will become the base. The cake is ready when the surface feels springy to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside to cool in the tin for 30 mins, then turn out on to a large wire rack, or use 2 smaller wire racks pushed together.",

Add the zest of 4 lemons, 40g ground almonds, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1\u00bd tbsp of lemon juice. Bake for 50 mins, testing as before.",

            "Repeat steps 1-4 so you have 2 bottom tiers, 2 middle tiers and 1 top tier. Leave until all the cakes are completely cool. Once cooled, the cakes can be wrapped in a double layer of cling film and kept in a cool place for up to 4 days, or frozen for up to 1 month. To defrost, leave the cakes at room temperature overnight.",

Remove from the heat, stir through the mint, then allow to cool and steep for up to 5 hrs. Sieve into a jug or bowl, then cover with cling film and chill until ready to use.

Use the cake paddle or a large chopping board to help move the sponges and flip one of the largest layers onto a serving plate or cake stand, so that the top of the cake now becomes the bottom. Spoon over a little of the reserved syrup, then spread with some of the lemon mascarpone filling using a small offset spatula or knife. Drizzle over some of the lemon curd, then scatter with raspberries. Now top with the remaining layer, so the bottom of the cake now becomes the top, realigning the cocktail sticks to ensure the cake is level. Then layer more syrup, mascarpone, lemon curd and raspberries with the remaining 30cm sponges.",

Snip the straws where they protrude from the cake, so that they are flush with the top. Repeat the assembly with the two 20cm cakes, placing these onto thin cake boards before sitting on top of the larger cakes, then poke in more straws to support the top tie. Finally, assemble the top layer using the same method. Spread any remaining mascarpone on top, then dust the tiers lightly with icing sugar. Decorate with an assortment of mixed berries, mint sprigs and flowers (see tip, left)."

Strip the sage leaves from the stem and roughly chop \u2013 you should have about 2 tbsps. Scatter over the vegetables and season. Roast for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through.",

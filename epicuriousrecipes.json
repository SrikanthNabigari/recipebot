        "desc": "When I was first served corn ice cream, I thought the guy who made it was having a laugh. To me, corn meant succotash, soup, and steamy ears buttered and sprinkled with crunchy sea salt. It did not mean dessert. Yet while it took me a good minute to get my head around the idea, it took me only about half a second to eat every last bit. Of course, corn ice cream makes perfect sense\u2014corn is good mates with dairy; and during summer, the veg is sweeter than strawberries, peaches, and other fruits commonly spotted in ice cream. A healthy drizzle of butterscotch and a scattering of caramel popcorn add sweet\u2013salty complexity and crunch."

The bars are perfect for potlucks because they're portable and super-easy to make. The problem is (for me!) that they're always way too sweet.

This was a dish I came up with to satisfy some of those cravings in a mindful way, rather than constantly caving to my ultimate weakness: chips and salsa (which I would happily have eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The millet is hearty and filling, and the beans provide a good amount of protein and fiber, which helped keep me full...especially useful because I always seemed to be hungry. I love to throw the peppery arugula and radishes in this mix because they lighten it up a bit and give good crunch. The dressing is bright and tangy, with lots of lime and toasted cumin. If you go for the extras, a ladle of salsa and little dollop of sour cream at the end makes it all very messy, but very, very delicious."

Now I\u2019m giving traditional orange Julius an upgrade by combining the vitamins C and A, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids found in sweet potatoes with tangy orange. This is a winning combination, light and refreshing with pops of citrus, yet dense and filling because of the sweet potato. Enjoy this as a meal or post-workout drink, or split it with a loved one for a snack! It\u2019s ridiculously good."

Follow the recipe above, adding 8 to 16 ounces chopped seitan once the onion is translucent. Drizzle in a tablespoon or two of soy sauce.

Swish the lentils around with your hand, then drain the water through a fine-mesh sieve. Return any dal from the sieve to the saucepan and repeat, washing, agitating, and draining, until the water runs absolutely clear. It will probably take 7 to 10 changes of water. Pour the 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the pot to cover the lentils. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, skim any scum that rises to the surface, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Add the turmeric and cook until the dal is quite creamy, 45 to 60 minutes. Stir the dal regularly as it simmers or it can catch at the bottom of the pan and burn. If the dal starts to look dry before the lentils are cooked, add hot water (from the tap is fine). Season well with salt.\n                                    ",

When the dal is ready, tip the tarka over the dal, stir to partially combine, then sprinkle the cilantro on top.

Add 1 minced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Scrape in 1 teaspoon grated ginger and cook to take away some of its rawness, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 small tomatoes that have been diced, 1 or 2 green chiles split lengthwise, and 2 curry leaves (optional). Fry until the tomato starts to break up, 5 to 7 minutes more. Stir most of the mixture into the cooked dal and let simmer for 5 minutes. Check for seasoning, then tip the remaining tarka over the dal.

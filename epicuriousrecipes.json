        "desc": "When I was first served corn ice cream, I thought the guy who made it was having a laugh. To me, corn meant succotash, soup, and steamy ears buttered and sprinkled with crunchy sea salt. It did not mean dessert. Yet while it took me a good minute to get my head around the idea, it took me only about half a second to eat every last bit. Of course, corn ice cream makes perfect sense\u2014corn is good mates with dairy; and during summer, the veg is sweeter than strawberries, peaches, and other fruits commonly spotted in ice cream. A healthy drizzle of butterscotch and a scattering of caramel popcorn add sweet\u2013salty complexity and crunch."

The bars are perfect for potlucks because they're portable and super-easy to make. The problem is (for me!) that they're always way too sweet.

This was a dish I came up with to satisfy some of those cravings in a mindful way, rather than constantly caving to my ultimate weakness: chips and salsa (which I would happily have eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). The millet is hearty and filling, and the beans provide a good amount of protein and fiber, which helped keep me full...especially useful because I always seemed to be hungry. I love to throw the peppery arugula and radishes in this mix because they lighten it up a bit and give good crunch. The dressing is bright and tangy, with lots of lime and toasted cumin. If you go for the extras, a ladle of salsa and little dollop of sour cream at the end makes it all very messy, but very, very delicious."

Now I\u2019m giving traditional orange Julius an upgrade by combining the vitamins C and A, potassium, fiber, and carotenoids found in sweet potatoes with tangy orange. This is a winning combination, light and refreshing with pops of citrus, yet dense and filling because of the sweet potato. Enjoy this as a meal or post-workout drink, or split it with a loved one for a snack! It\u2019s ridiculously good."

Follow the recipe above, adding 8 to 16 ounces chopped seitan once the onion is translucent. Drizzle in a tablespoon or two of soy sauce.
